This is a Scanner App, made with OpenCV and pillow. The are two varients:
The first one is CustomScanner, in which the code uses the device's camera to capture an image ad saves it as a pdf when the user hits 's' on their keyboard.
The second one is ReaderWIthPhone, in which the user is required to use an app called 'IP Webcam' to capture images. For this to work, you'll need to change the 'url' in the code according to your 'Ip Webcam's Server', which you'll see once you open the app and click on 'Start Server'.
